        <h2>Fusilli Mushroom Pasta</h2>
        
        <p>This mushroom pasta is a new all-time favourite! <br>It's creamy, intensely flavourful, <br>and perfect for days when you might need a big bowl of comfort. <br>Luckily, it's also incredibly quick and easy to make, <br>with all the ingredients simply tossed into one large pot <br>and cooked until al dente!</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>2 tsp (10 mL) vegetable oil</li> 
            <li>2 medium shallots, finely chopped</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 red hot chili, finely minced</li>
            <li>2 vegetable bouillon cubes*</li>
            <li>2 cups (480 mL) water*</li>
            <li>⅔ cups (399 mL) canned full-fat coconut milk</li>
            <li>2 cups (140 g) button mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 cups (172 g) oyster mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>14.1 oz (400 g) dry fusilli pasta</li>
            <li>¼ cup (38 g) sun-dried tomato in oil, drained, chopped</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp (4 g) nutritional yeast flakes</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp (15 mL) sodium-reduced soy sauce </li>
            <li>1 tsp (2 g) paprika powder</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>4 cups (120 g) fresh spinach</li>
          </ul>

         <h4>Steps</h4> 
            <ol>
                <li>Add the oil to a large pot on high heat. When hot, add the shallots, garlic, and chili, and sauté until lightly golden, about 3 minutes, adding a splash of water as needed to deglaze the pan.</li>
                <li>Add all of the remaining ingredients to the pot, except for the spinach, and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer with the lid partially covered. Stir occasionally to prevent burning.</li>
                <li>When the pasta is al dente, after about 12 - 15 minutes, remove from the heat and add in the spinach. Stir to combine.</li>
                <li>Squeeze overtop some fresh lemon juice, sprinkle on thinly sliced basil leaves or some red chilli flakes if desired, and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
