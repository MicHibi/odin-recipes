        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Place a saucepan on medium-high heat, and add the frozen blueberries. Let the berries thaw for about 3 - 4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Alternatively, you could thaw the blueberries with the microwave.</li>
            <li>Use the back of a wooden spatula to mash some of the blueberries.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and let the berries cool off slightly.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine all of the remaining ingredients, except for the yogurt.</li>
            <li>Add half of the blueberries to the bottom of a mason jar or airtight container, and add the oat mixture in next.</li>
            <li>Add the yogurt and the other half of the blueberries on top, give it a gentle stir with a spoon to create a beautiful purple swirl, if desired.</li>
            <li>Cover and let it sit overnight in the fridge.</li>
            <li>The next morning, top with desired toppings, and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
