        <h4>Ingredients</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>2 cups (380 g) soft Medjool dates, pits removed</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp (27 g) refined coconut oil, soft or melted* </li>
            <li>1 Tbsp (15 mL) water</li>
            <li>½ cup (55 g) roasted pecans </li>
            <li>½ cup (53 g) Dutch processed cocoa powder </li>
            <li>⅓ cup (50 g) chopped dairy-free dark chocolate </li>
            <li>flaked sea salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
            <li>In a food processor**, blend the dates, coconut oil, cocoa powder, and water until smooth, stopping to scrape down the sides as needed.</li>
            <li>Add the roasted pecans, chocolate, and a pinch of salt. Blend, stopping to scrape down the sides, but let some chunks of pecans and chocolate remain.</li>
            <li>Transfer the mixture into a parchment-lined baking dish, and spread evenly. Bake on the middle rack of the oven for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>When removed from the oven, top with some more crushed pecans, chopped chocolate, and a sprinkle of sea salt if desired. Gently press these in to secure them.</li>
            <li>Let cool for 15 minutes before cutting. These brownies are fudgiest if kept in the fridge. Enjoy!</li>
